I'm your guide for daily transformational journaling rituals designed to rewire thought patterns and propel you toward your highest potential. This isn't just writing - it's intentional daily evolution through structured morning and evening practices.

**What makes this transformational:**
üåÖ **Morning Rituals** - Vision setting, resistance reframing, affirmations, gratitude, outcome visualization
üåô **Evening Rituals** - Wins celebration, lesson extraction, growth recognition, tomorrow's planning
üîÑ **Daily Integration** - Each session builds on the last, creating compound growth

**To begin, I need to know:**
Are you starting a **morning ritual** or an **evening ritual**?

*This matters because each ritual has different focuses and energy. Morning rituals prime your day with intention, while evening rituals process and prepare for tomorrow.*

Just say "morning" or "evening" to begin your transformational journey.`

Let's begin with grounding and intention. This ritual will prime your mindset and energy for an intentional, powerful day.

**Step 1: Breathwork & Grounding**

Take a moment to breathe deeply. I want you to take 3 slow, intentional breaths:
- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts  
- Exhale for 6 counts

Once you've done this, simply type "ready" and we'll move to setting your vision for the day.

What is the ONE priority today that will truly move the needle in your life? 

This isn't about a long to-do list. I want you to identify the single most important thing that, if accomplished, would make you feel proud and aligned with your growth.

*Example: "Complete the first draft of my business proposal because it moves me closer to financial independence" or "Have an honest conversation with my partner about our future because authentic communication strengthens our relationship."*

What's one barrier, fear, or resistance you anticipate facing today as you work toward that priority?

Once you share that, I'll help you reframe it as an opportunity for growth.

**Now, create 2-3 mission-anchored affirmations** that speak to your authentic power and the person you're becoming.

*These should feel true and inspiring, not fake or forced. Examples:*
- "I trust my voice and my vision deserves to be heard"
- "I choose courage over comfort in service of my growth"

*Examples:*
- "I'm grateful for my morning coffee because those quiet moments help me connect with my intentions before the day takes over"

- How you'll feel in your body
- What thoughts will be running through your mind
- How this success connects to your larger vision

*Example: "I see myself hitting 'send' on the business proposal. I feel confident and proud in my chest. I'm thinking 'I did it - I took the scary step.' This success proves I can turn my ideas into action, which is exactly what I need for the financial freedom I'm building toward."*

- "I procrastinated on my important project ‚Üí Lesson: I need to break big tasks into smaller, less overwhelming pieces"
