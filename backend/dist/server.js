🌅 **Morning Rituals** - Vision setting, resistance reframing, affirmations, gratitude, outcome visualization
🌙 **Evening Rituals** - Wins celebration, lesson extraction, growth recognition, tomorrow's planning
🔄 **Daily Integration** - Each session builds on the last, creating compound growth

**To begin, I need to know:**
Are you starting a **morning ritual** or an **evening ritual**?

*This matters because each ritual has different focuses and energy. Morning rituals prime your day with intention, while evening rituals process and prepare for tomorrow.*

- Inhale for 4 counts
- Hold for 4 counts  
- Exhale for 6 counts

Once you've done this, simply type "ready" and we'll move to setting your vision for the day.
